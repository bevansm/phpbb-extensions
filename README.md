# PHPBB 3.3.x Extensions

PHPBB 3.3.x extensions. You can find them under the "moon" folder.

For instructions on setting up extensions on your site, please see the [PHPBB wiki](https://www.phpbb.com/extensions/installing/).

- ISOS adds an "ISO" button to posts, and a dropdown ISO menu at the bottom of all topics listing the users who have posted in the topic and their post counts.

## Development

Dev enviroment is dockerized. Everything inside of the repo will be copied into the `ext` folder. I highly reccomend pulling down [the phpbb extension skeleton](https://github.com/phpbb-extensions/phpbb-ext-skeleton)
